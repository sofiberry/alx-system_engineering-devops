Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: Jan 21, 2024, 10:00 AM - Jan 21, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The user authentication service experienced complete downtime during the outage. Users were unable to log in or access any authenticated features. Approximately 25% of our user base was affected, resulting in a significant disruption to their experience.

Timeline:

- 10:00 AM: The issue was detected when automated monitoring alerts indicated a sudden spike in failed authentication attempts.
- Actions taken: The investigation started by examining the authentication service logs, searching for any error patterns or anomalies. Additionally, server resource utilization and network connectivity were analyzed to identify potential underlying causes.
- Misleading investigation paths: Initial assumptions pointed towards a potential database bottleneck due to increased traffic, leading to extensive analysis of the database performance. However, this turned out to be a misleading path.
- 10:30 AM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team and senior backend engineers for further investigation and resolution.
- 11:00 AM: The team identified a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which caused an incorrect routing of requests to the authentication service.
- 11:30 AM: The load balancer settings were adjusted to correctly route traffic to the authentication service, and a new configuration was deployed.
- 12:00 PM: User login functionality was restored, and the authentication service began processing requests normally.
- 2:00 PM: The outage was officially declared resolved, and normal operations resumed.

Root Cause and Resolution:

- Root cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused a disruption in the routing of incoming requests to the authentication service. This resulted in requests being dropped or misrouted, leading to the complete outage of the service.
- Resolution: The load balancer settings were reviewed and adjusted to ensure proper routing of requests to the authentication service. The corrected configuration was deployed, resolving the issue and restoring service functionality.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- Improvement opportunities:
  1. Strengthen monitoring capabilities to proactively detect misconfigurations in the load balancer and other critical components.
  1. Implement automated tests to verify the routing and functionality of essential services after configuration changes.
  1. Enhance the incident response process by establishing clear communication channels and defining escalation paths.
- Tasks to address the issue:
  1. Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
  1. Develop and implement automated tests to validate load balancer functionality after configuration changes.
  1. Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to promptly detect and mitigate similar routing issues in the future.
  1. Conduct a post-incident review meeting to share lessons learned, discuss improvements, and assign responsibilities for implementing corrective measures.

In conclusion, the web stack outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to a complete disruption of the user authentication service. The incident was promptly detected, escalated, and resolved through the adjustment of load balancer configurations. To prevent similar incidents, improvements in monitoring, testing, and incident response processes will be implemented, ensuring the stability and reliability of our services.
